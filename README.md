# Leetcode IDE Clone

**Leetcode IDE Clone** (LeetPad) is a web-based code editor inspired by the Leetcode coding interface. Built using **React.js**, it provides a simple and clean environment for writing and testing code directly in the browser. While currently focused on frontend architecture, it is designed to scale with real-time code execution features using APIs like Judge0.

This project is ideal for learners and developers looking to simulate the Leetcode experience and experiment with frontend design and editor workflows.
